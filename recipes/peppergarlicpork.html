        <p>If you like garlic and love black pepper you'll love these skillet pork chops. Simple, yet, very tasty!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (1 1/2 inches thick) boneless center-cut pork chops</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork chops, Worcestershire, 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, and black pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag.<br>
                Marinate chops in the mixture for about 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Heat remaining oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.<br> 
                Remove pork from the marinade and place into the skillet to brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. <br>
                Reduce heat and let simmer, basting with marinade during cooking, until no longer pink in the centers, 15 to 20 minutes. <br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). </li>
        </ol>
